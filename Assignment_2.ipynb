It makes sense that two books with religion as the topic (e.g.  `398.txt` and `3296.txt`) would have more words in common than a book that discusses religion and a book that discusses science fiction (e.g. books `84.txt` and `398.txt`). \n",

    "#### Answer\n",
    "The Euclidean distance between Frankenstein (Book 84) vs. Adam and Eve (Book 398) is smaller than the Euclidean distances between Adam and Eve vs. Confessions of St. Augustine. This does not make sense because Adam and Eve should be more similar to Confessions of St. Augustine. A third comparison between books of similar length (Frankenstein and Confessions) shows an even larger Euclidean distance. A large Euclidean distance is expected for these two books however, as they have very different topics. So, Euclidean distance is also not a good measurement for books of very different lengths. Because if one book is much shorter, even though it has the same/similar topic, it will report a large Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw distance coefficient also does not have an obvious upper bound. We only know that the lower bound of 0 = absolute identity. So, we can rank dissimilarities, but we don't really know how similar the books are."

    "We can apply length normalization methods (as described in Week 12 - Feature_engineering_1) so that documents of different lengths have comparable weights. This makes the model applied less sensitive to the scale of the features. We could improve our previous analysis using Euclidean distance by performing instead a normalized Euclidean distance.\n",
